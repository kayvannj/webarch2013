Browser sends a GET request with  http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki as a parameter to its DNS server, DNS server looks up the domain of the specified URL and send the appropriate ip address to the browser to get connect to. Then browser will send the same get message to that IP address and will receive the above respond but since the respond contains a LOCATION header attribute, browser will redirect and send a new GET request to http://en.wikipedia.org and as a respond will receive the respond from Wikipedia website and display the content to user.
