I have good knowledge of internet and computer networking also I have done 
some PHP and HTML programing back in the day but not much of JS. I'm also 
doing Ruby on Rails in one of my classes.

My favorit feature of Google Chrome is its Developer Tools which let me 
identify parts of the webpage very easily. My favorit from FireFox is its 
plugins, I have used GreaseMonkeywith its scripts and I was amaized with 
what it can do.
