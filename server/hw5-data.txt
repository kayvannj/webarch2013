1) app.py uses GET and its arguments to set the title and name parameter in the home.html and display it to user.

2) I used this request to change the redirection of /wiki

PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-length: 22
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://kayvann.com

which resulted to:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 29
Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
Date: Thu, 03 Oct 2013 07:32:59 GMT

Stored wiki => http://kayvann.com

2.1) And later verified by sending a GET to /wiki which resulted in

HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 243
Location: http://kayvann.com
Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3

3) I used this post request:

POST /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-length: 18
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://nbc.com

and got this result:
